## Challenges in hiring graduates _jaman now_
---
- Don't have practical experience, only theories
- Very good GPA, but forgot everything they learned
- Don't have passion in their field 
- Only learn what were taught in university
---
## The good ones are rare
---
## What should you prepare from now?
---
## 1) Internship
---
- Most startups have internship program
- Usually for 2-3 months, some allow 2-4 **weeks**
- You will learn skills used in real world & mentored by expert

- Aim to be a freshgraduate with 4 year working experience
