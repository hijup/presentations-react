## Not really...
---
## My insights after interviewing hundreds...
---
### As interviewee
I am so proud of my GPA, it reflects how great I am
***
### As interviewer
GPA is only 1 factor to hire 
---
### As interviewee
I have studied in my major for 4 years, I know everything now
***
### As interviewer
I am looking for someone capable to learn quickly and easy to train
---
### As interviewee
I am not in the major I am applying for, I am not so confident
***
### As interviewer
Major is important factor to consider, but the most important thing is your skill
---
### As interviewee
I don't need money, so I don't need internship
***
### As interviewer
There is a gap between industry and academic world. Having internship experience is huge advantage
---
## Start-up life?
---
### Compared to corporate:
- Not so formal environment
- Your co-worker is your friend
- Higher impact per individual
- Flexible, but higher commitment
- Expected to learn and self motivated to learn
- Disrupt or disrupted
---

## Challenges in hiring graduates _jaman now_
---
- Don't have practical experience, only theories
- Very good GPA, but forgot everything they learned after exam
- Don't have passion in their field 
- Only learn what were taught in university
---
## The good ones are rare
---
## So, how to be the rare ones?
---
## What should you prepare from now?
---
## 1) Internship
---
- Most start-ups have internship program
- Usually for 2-3 months, some allow 2-4 **weeks**
- You will learn skills used in real world & mentored by expert
---

## 2) Start doing side projects
---
- Can be anything, e.g. navigating Google Street with Face
- Share it on LinkedIn, Github, etc.
- Best motivator: fun
- Aim to be a freshgraduate with 4 year working experience
---
## 3) Acknowledge that you know nothing
---

## 5) Update your LinkedIn
---
- Nowadays, recruiters use LinkedIn to search for talents
- Excellent talents do not actively searching for a job, jobs come to them
---
## 6) Review your online footprint
---
- It's just a Google search away
- Maintain good manners, online and offline :)
---
## 7) Attend meetups and make some friends
---
- Many start-ups are willing to share their learnings
- Mostly free, open to anyone
- Do subscribe to Meetup.com & Eventbrite.com
- Or... why don't you be the speaker? :)
---
## 8) Focus on High Leverage activities
---
### Leverage = Impact / Time Invested
---
## 9) Get to know the roles
---
- Digital Marketing
- Product Owner/Manager
- UX Researcher
- Copywriter
- Data Scientist
- Data Engineer
- ...
---

## Lastly...
